        <p>Welcome to the Maze Game! Congratulations You've been accepted into Georgia Tech!
            Youâ€™re super stoked to begin your journey and begin to prepare for the first day of classes. At this stage, the player arrives at the first level of the maze.
             Throughout the twists and turns, the player will encounter challenges! 
      </p>
        <p>The challenges a student will run into play into common challenges a student may face in the first, second, third, and fourth year. 
            For example, a player may run into something like "Oh no! You gained freshman 15." or "Waitlisted for a class, position: 230." or
             "Graduation delayed!".</p>
        <p>Of course, running into challenges in college is inevitable, so these challenges act as more of a funny milestone that just frequently reflects the common challenges Georgia Tech students go through. Collect all milestones for a funny achievement!</p>
