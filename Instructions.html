        <p>Welcome to the Maze Game! Congragulations You've been Accepted into Georgia Tech!
            You’re super stoked to begin your journey and begin to prepare for the first day of classes. At this stage, the player arrives at the first level of the maze.
             Throughout the twists and turns, the player will encounter challenges! 
      </p>
        <p>The challenges a student will run into play into common challenges a student may face in the first, second, third, and fourth year. 
            For example, in the “freshman” level, a player may run into something like “Oh no! You gained freshman 15. 
            Move back 5 spaces” or “Waitlisted for a class, position: 230.
             Graduation delayed!” and this could add on extra time to a player’s maze completion. </p>
        <p>Of course, running into challenges in college is inevitable, so some of these challenges act as more of a funny milestone that just frequently reflects the common challenges Georgia Tech students go through. Collect all milestones for a funny achievement!</p>
