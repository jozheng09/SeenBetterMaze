# Will I Graduate?
2700 Final Game Project

Game summary: Congratulations! You’ve just been accepted into Georgia Tech as a freshman. You’re super stoked to begin your journey and begin to prepare for the first day of classes. At this stage, the player arrives at the first level of the maze. Throughout the twists and turns, the player will encounter challenges! 

The challenges a student will run into play into common challenges a student may face in the first, second, third, and fourth year. For example, in the “freshman” level, a player may run into something like “Oh no! You gained freshman 15. Move back 5 spaces” or “Waitlisted for a class, position: 230. Graduation delayed!” 

Of course, running into challenges in college is inevitable, so some of these challenges act as more of a funny milestone that just frequently reflects the common challenges Georgia Tech students go through.

How to Play: Use the arrow keys to move through the maze, and finish all four mazes to graduate!
